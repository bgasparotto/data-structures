# Data Structures and Algorithms
*Data Structures* organise and store data. Different examples are arrays and trees.
*Algorithms* describe the steps you have to perform in order to accomplish a specific task. An example would be a sort algorithm.

## Big-O Notation
- The Big-O notation is a way of expressing the *time complexity* of an algorithm related to the `n` number of items it has to process:
  - O(1): Constant
  - O(logn): Logarithmic (base 2)
  - O(n): Linear
  - O(nlogn): n log-star n (base 2)
  - O(n²): Quadratic

```The right way of reading the notation is "O of 1, O of log n", etc```

```
Binary logarithms (log n) are the inverse function of the power of two n² function. They are
commonly used in binary search and related algorithms.
